While previous work on Twitter data places individual messages or whole communities as their focus, this paper aims to detect stance at the user level. We develop a system that classifies Dutch Twitter users, incorporating not only the texts that users produce, but also their actions in the form of following and retweeting. These heterogeneous data are modelled in a graph structure. Graph Convolutional Networks are trained to learn whether user nodes belong to the skeptical or non-skeptical group. Results show that all types of information are used by the model, and that especially user biographies, follows and retweets improve the predictions. On a test set of unseen users, performance declines somewhat, which is expected considering these users tweeted less and had fewer connections in the graph on average. To consider multiple degrees of vaccine skepticism, the test set was annotated with more fine-grained labels and the model was repurposed to do multiclass classification. While the model trained on binary labels was unsuited for this additional task, heterogeneous information networks were found useful to both accurately model and visualize complex user behaviors."}

Currently, all existing topic tracking methods use lexical information by matching word usage. However, no studies has ever experimented with the use of semantic information for tracking topics. Hence, we explore a novel semantic-based method using word embeddings. Our results show that a semantic-based approach to topic tracking is on par with the lexical approach but makes different mistakes. This suggest that both methods may complement each other."}

{"Authors":"Manandise, E","Article Title":"Extracting Domain Terms from Data Model Elements Task Overview in One Implementation","Author Keywords":"Abjad; Digraphs; Data model element; Disemvowelment; Term extraction; Trigraphs; XML\/XSD documents; XPaths","Abstract":"In the compliance domain of tax laws, a barrier to term extraction from documents written in natural language is getting a sizable training set of documents to train a well-grounded term-extraction model. To alleviate term-extraction silence, i.e. the outcome of the automated process missing legitimate term candidates, we extract terms from a string datatype that is written in a quasi-natural language. Domain software applications rely on structured content in XML documents for their processes. One type of XML data is the element; elements have names typically written in a variant of a natural language. Term extraction restores the element names to the detected natural language. These extracted expressions are either novel terms for our terminology or are flagged as synonymous expressions to existing terms. Increasing term coverage improves semantic parsing, query understanding and explanation generation. For a subset of XML documents of one tax-domain software application, we augment the existing terminology by 49%."}

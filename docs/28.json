Fake news spreaders are making use of these platforms to exploit the gullibility of common people to satisfy their own purpose. As a consequence, identification of Fake News spreaders is of prime consideration. The present paper focuses on automatic identification of Fake News Spreaders using Machine Learning based techniques. Different linguistic, personalized, stylistic features and word embeddings have been extracted form a large collection of tweet data to train the model. The dataset used for the model is taken from PANACLEF Profiling Fake News Spreaders on Twitter competition. The above features along with the clickbait feature have been found to achieve the best accuracy of 77% with XGBoost classifier. This outperforms the state of the art deep learning technique, viz. FakeBERT, as well as several other deep learning-based methods available in literature."}

We introduce kern, a labeling environment used by machine learning experts and subject matter experts to create training data and find manual labeling errors powered by weak supervision, active transfer learning, and confident learning. We explain the current workflow and system overview and showcase the benefits of our system in an intent classification experiment, where we reduce the labeling error rate of a given dataset by an absolute 4.9% while improving the F-1 score of a baseline classifier by a total of 9.7%."}

This research explores the relationship between semantic structures and viewpoint; demonstrating that the viewpoint diversity in a selection of documents can be increased by utilizing extracted semantic and sentiment features. Small portions of documents matching search terms were embedded in a semantic space using word vectors and sentiment scores. The resulting features were used to train a support vector machine to differentiate documents by viewpoint in a topically homogeneous corpus. When evaluating the top 10% most probable predictions for each viewpoint, this approach yielded a lift of between 1.26 and 2.04."}

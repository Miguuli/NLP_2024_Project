In this context, the ability to quickly assign bug reports to specialized technical groups (TG) is essential to save time, reduce costs and gain competitiveness. An issue wrongly assigned increases the risk of negative impact in a project's budget and schedule. This paper presents an analysis of automated approaches to recommend specialized TGs to fix a new bug. The experiments show the effectiveness of the analyzed method in finding the target TG in the first rank positions, improving the Accuracyal in 7% and the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in 3% compared with our previous work. More significantly, the new method reduces the model's training time from 5 h to 22 min. These results were validated in a real-world dataset composed of 410,631 bug reports obtained from the projects of a global smartphone manufacturer."}
